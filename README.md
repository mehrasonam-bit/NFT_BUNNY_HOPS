# NFT_BUNNY_HOPS
Bunny_Hops NFTs generated by using python code

This program was coded for fun and to learn more about NFTs and upskill my python skills. These cute little bunnies are generated by python program The program has three scripts: main.py - Which has a subprocess module imported to run the bunny.py script to number of times. I have added this code to save clicking run time, there may be more feasible way to do so. But I could find this one to save my time. bunny.py- Generates random bunnies using random module bunny_array.py- has arrays listed for different types of bunnies

I have made use of excel to make arrays, I found that is a easy way to make your numpy array tables and makes less mistakes.Once the array was created I just copied to my replit program. Yes, the program is written in replit I find it easy to use.For reference, I have attached the excel file too.

Error encountered: While the program was running fine and was generating bunnies but I was not able to download the folder to my desktop. I used the trick told to me by one of my friend, to change the name of the folder manually and then download it. Voila! It worked. I was able to download it.

NFTs: I uploaded some of my bunnies to SOLsea, a art marketplace which works on SOLANA. Minted 11 of them on the platform.

Why SOLSEA instead of OPENSEA? The proof of stake system is the main reason why SOLANA platforms are called Ethereum killer. At the moment, they’re more efficient and answer the one big concern that many world governments, experts and billionaires have about cryptos — their environmental footprint. That is the reason I chose Solsea over Opensea which works on ETH.

Another reason being SOLANA is gasless NFTS with very low gas fees. Solana gas fees are low — and I mean really low. They're about $0.00025 per transaction.
